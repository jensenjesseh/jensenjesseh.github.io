      <p>The Milkshake Machine is a machine designed to create a perfectly consistent milkshake with little user effort. Following simple steps, anyone can operate a milkshake machine. This machine requires components such as a blender, a DC motor pump, a breadboard, and some electrical components to build.</p>
      <p>The Milkshake Machine requires two simple steps in order to be used. First, the user must place one cup (8 oz) of ice cream into the Milkshake Machine. Then, using a touch screen, the user selects the desired thickness for their milkshake from a list of either ‘Thick’, ‘Medium’, or ‘Thin’. The Milkshake Machine then automatically adds milk to the blender and turns the blender on to the correct speed and length to create a milkshake of the consistency chosen.</p>
      <pThe Milkshake Machine is built using a combination of several electrical and mechanical components. First of all, this machine uses a Mainstay six speed blender as its source of mixing the milkshakes. The machine also uses a breadboard in order to connect components, a power relay to switch on AC power to the blender, an LCD touch screen, a DC motor pump, and other electrical components.</p>
