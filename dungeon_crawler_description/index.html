      <h1>Dungeon Crawler Game</h1>
      <h2>Team project with Kylie Williamson and Aaron Lam</h2>
      <p>This game was made over the course of three-to-four weeks. It was coded from scratch (with the exception of the Box2DJS physics engine) using JavaScript and HTML 5.</p>
      <p>This project has the following characteristics:</p>
      <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Procedurally generated</li>
            <li>Reconfigurable controls</li>
            <li>Particle Effects</li>
            <li>Frustum culling (using a quad-tree data structure)</li>
            <li>Tile Rendering</li>
            <li>2D Camera</li>
            <li>2D Physics integration (uses Box2DJS physics engine) </li>
            <li>Server-based high-scores</li>
            <li>Enemy AI</li>
            <li>Player progression (level-ups)</li>
            <li>Save/load game functionality</li>
            <li>Enemy triggering</li>
          </ul></p>
          
       <h2>Notes about this project:</h2>
       <p>While my team and I collectively worked on most of the features of the game, I was directly over the frustum culling and quad-tree functionality that prevents enemies outside of the player's view to update and render. This makes the program more efficient. I was also directly over the enemy AI, enemy triggering, and sound and music. My team and I made all of the original artwork. The music was not made by the team but is from a creative commons source.</p>

      <p>The game can be played below. The server-based high-score functionality has been disabled for this instance of the game.</p>
