  <h1>Input Corrective Drawing Pad</h1>
  <p>This project was designed for individuals with fine motor disability as a way for them to draw and write despite shaky input. It uses a line-smoothing algorithm to correct input and, if the device is in writing mode, feeds the input through a convolutional neural network to recognize the handwriting. The result is then output as text to the screen. </p>
   <p>This project was carried through the entire engineering design process including creating a requirements document, a specifications document, performing several design reviews, and constructing a user manual. The project was presented at Utah State University ECE Senior Design Night.</p>
   <p>Further implementation details as well as the engineering design documents can be viewed below.
