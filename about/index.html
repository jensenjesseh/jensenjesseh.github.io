  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I just graduated (December 2018) from school at Utah State University where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering. In addition to my degree-required hardware and low-level programming classes, I studied computer graphics (OpenGL) and FPGA design (VHDL and Verilog). While attending school, I worked for Prismview Electronics as an intern where I gained hands-on experience with the engineering design process and hardware testing.</p>
   <p>I currently live in Tokyo, Japan (Jiyugaoka area) with my wife, Kylie Jensen, who is also a programmer. In my free time I love to rock climb and program videogames with my wife. </p>
