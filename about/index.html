  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I currently work in Tokyo for a great startup company called PocketChange. With this company, I have worked on creating and maintaining E-money kiosks that are now located all across Japan and parts of Asia. Before this, I graduated in 2018 from school at Utah State University where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering. While attending school, I worked for Prismview Electronics as an intern where I gained hands-on experience with the engineering design process and hardware testing.</p>
   <p>I currently live in Tokyo, Japan (Setagaya-ku area) with my wife, Kylie Jensen, who is also a programmer. When I have free time, I love to study Japanese, rock climb, and work on personal projects.</p>
