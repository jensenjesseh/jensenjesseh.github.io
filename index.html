<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hello, I'm Jesse Jensen!</h1>
	<p>I am a computer engineer with experience in both circuit design and programming. I focus on low-level and embedded system programming and am experienced in the C++, C, Rust, ARM and MIPS assembly, and JavaScript languages. In addition to my programming skills, I also have experience creating circuits and doing printed circuit board (PCB) design. In the past, I have worked with programming FPGAs in the Verilog and VHDL hardware description languages and I am eager for future opportunities to get into digital circuits again. Building projects, with both hardware and software, to find solutions to real-world problems is my passion. While my current personal projects are still in early phases due to limited time, please see some of my earlier projects and get to know a bit more about me by using the links above.<em> <a href="/about">More about me</p>
